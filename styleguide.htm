				<p>For all pages except the homepage the <em>page title</em> is a heading level one (on this page “Styleguide”). For the homepage the <em>site title</em> (contained in <code>#site_context</code> and usually replaced with a logo) is the heading level one.</p>

			<div class="topic">
				<h2>Inline elements</h2>
				<p>Inline elements are things like paragraphs, you'd do well to inspect the source of the folowing examples:</p>
			</div><!-- .topic -->
			<div class="example">
				<p>This page is designed as a markup guide for my own use. It is not intended to provide a <q lang="en-US">one markup
					 fits all situations</q> reference, but rather as a guide containing as many
					 <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> element references as possible, used in such a way as
					 to promote the semantic implementation of elements, attributes and tags. Here is a <a href="http://google.com" rel="friend external thomas">link to an external URL</a>.</p>
				<p>Dan Cederholm once gave a succinct definition of the <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code> attribute in his book <cite>Web
					 Standard Solutions</cite>. It's a <em>very</em> good book, and one that I <strong>still</strong> refer to today
					 <sup id="reference_1"><a href="#footnote_1">[1]</a></sup>. <del cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20020805/mod-edit.html#sec_13.1."
								title="text changed as a matter of oppinion after the fact">Many</del>
					 <ins datetime="2006-17-03T21:15:30-00:00">A number</ins> of the HTML elements used in this page are semantic, but rare. Some, such as
					 <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code> are useful mainly in niche fields, for example, in legal documentation one might define a
					 term.</p>
				<p>Inline quotes don't need quotation marks because the user agent adds them itself, as in this example: <q>That's what she said <q>yeah but is it?</q></q></p>
				<p>Images by default are inline <img src="/assets/images/smile.png" alt="icon: smile" /> the bottom of the image aligns with the baseline of the text within which it sits.</p>
			</div><!-- .example -->
		</div><!-- #inline.html5_section -->

		<div id="lists" class="html5_section">
			<div class="topic">
				<h2>Lists</h2>
				<p>Lists are simple enough, they look like this:</p>
			</div><!-- .topic -->
			<div class="example">
			<h3>An example of ordered lists</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>first
							<ol>
								 <li>first</li>
								 <li>second</li>
								 <li>third</li>
							</ol></li>
					<li>second</li>
					<li>third</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h3>An example of an unordered list</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>second</li>
					<li>first</li>
					<li>third</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>An example of a definition list</h3>
				<dl>
					<dt>definition term one</dt>
					<dd>definition data one</dd>
					<dt>definition term two</dt>
					<dd>definition data two</dd>
				</dl>
			</div><!-- .example -->
		</div><!-- #lists.html5_section -->

		<div id="blockquote" class="html5_section">
			<div class="topic">
				<h2>Blockquote</h2>
				<p>Blockquotes are used whenever the quote is not inline, or requires attributing.</p>
			</div><!-- .topic -->
			<div class="example">
				<blockquote cite="/styleguide.htm">
					<p>This is quoted text, it doesn't have speech marks in the text itself, those are added by the CSS.</p>
					<p>Blockquotes can contain any markup as they are block-level elements, including multiple paragraphs.</p>
					<p>The mark-up convention is derived from <a href="http://html5doctor.com/blockquote-q-cite/">http://html5doctor.com/blockquote-q-cite/</a> and <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/4675/">http://adactio.com/journal/4675/</a>.</p>
					<footer>
						<cite class="vcard"><a class="fn url" href="http://mattwilcox.net">Matt Wilcox</a></cite>,
						from the article <a href="/styleguide.htm">Styleguide</a>
					</footer>
				</blockquote>

				<p>Blockquote's are good, but the cite attribute isn't human-accessible, which is why you always want to put a hyperlink in there if the quoted source is available online. It's also worth noting that the cite is in a footer element in HTML5 because a footer gives information about the enclosing tag.</p>
