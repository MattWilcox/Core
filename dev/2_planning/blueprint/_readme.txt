blueprint

NOTE: This directory is usually set up as a website running under http://projectname.blueprint.local
NOTE: We use CodeKit to create blueprints.

A blueprint is a bare-bones version of what the website will be, a plan we can work from. It has no visual design and no real content â€“ but it allows users to click through to the various pages and sections we propose the site should have. Each page lists what type of content would be on that page, and any functionality it would have (like a contact form).

It is important the client is happy with the website blueprint, we require sign-off on it.
