		<!-- javascript
				 NOTE:      Javascript goes at the bottom of the page to enhance the perception of speed with page load.
										Most browsers are limited to two simultaneous http requests, so if we loaded the JS before the HTML
										the page would appear to load slowly (as it loads non-visible data before the visible data).
				 REFERENCE: http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom
				 NOTE:      I usually use lazy-loading so that a JS file scans the DOM, knows what JS files are needed and loads only
										those. JS manages itself, the HTML doesn't need to change, no unused resources are ever loaded. -->
